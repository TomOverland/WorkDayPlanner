## Demonstration of Application

## Description  
When you open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.  
When you scroll down, you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.  
When you view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.  
When you click into a timeblock, then the text for that event is saved in local storage.  
When you refresh the page the saved events will persist.
